# COMPUTER

![COMPUTER! WHAT THE FUCK!](http://originaldave77.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/picards-computer.jpg)

Go ahead. Talk to your computer.

## About

I have always been really jealous that Captain Picard could just yell, "Computer!" followed by a few terse commands, and get the results he wanted back from his ship in return. So, I dug up some old work I did with Julius and made this thing that controls a modern Linux desktop with voice commands.

## What can COMPUTER do?

Currently, COMPUTER handles commands for the following applications:

* **i3-wm**: Switch windows; switch to specific apps.
* **copyq**: Paste the contents of your clipboard into the presently in-focus X application.
* **deadbeef**: Play/Pause; Next track; Last track.
* **talking-clock**: Have the computer speak to you the time and current weather.
* **scrot**: Take a screenshot of the X screen.
* **fswebcam**: Have your webcam take a photo.

More are on the way, I promise!
